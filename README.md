## Full Stack Software Developer

## About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on solo projects in order to build a mixed portfolio of different projects with different languages.

My main goal is to find a job as a Fullstack Software Developer and help my team become as successful as possible.

I graduated from Code Institute and continue to hone on my skills by going to websites such as CodeCademy where I do coding challenges and work on new projects to improve as a dev.
